            <h2>Rachel Green</h2>
            <p>A fashion enthusiast and Monica Geller's best friend from childhood. Rachel first moves in with Monica in
                season one after nearly marrying Barry Farber. Rachel and Ross Geller are later involved in an on-again,
                off-again relationship throughout the series. Rachel dates other men during the series, such as an
                Italian neighbor, Paolo, in season one; Joshua Bergin, a client from Bloomingdale's, in season four; Tag
                Jones, her assistant, in season seven; and Joey Tribbiani in season ten. Rachel's first job is as a
                waitress at the coffee house Central Perk, but she later becomes an assistant buyer at Bloomingdale's in
                season three, and a buyer at Ralph Lauren in season five. Rachel and Ross have a daughter named Emma in
                "The One Where Rachel Has a Baby, Part Two" at the end of season eight. In the final episode of the
                series, Ross and Rachel confess their love for each other, and Rachel gives up a job in Paris to be with
                him.</p>

                Drake Ramoray. Joey has many short-term girlfriends. Despite his womanizing, Joey is innocent, caring,
                and well-intentioned. Joey often uses the catchphrase pick-up line "How you doin'?" in his attempts to
                win over most of the women he meets. Joey rooms with his best friend Chandler for years, and later with
                Rachel. He falls in love with Rachel in season eight, but Rachel politely tells Joey that she does not
                share his feelings. They eventually date briefly in season ten, but after realizing it will not work due
                to their friendship and Rachel's complicated relationship with Ross, they return to being friends.</p>

                until Richard expresses that he does not want to have children. Monica and Chandler later start a

                with Monica, Chandler dated Janice Hosenstein in season one and subsequently broke up with her many

                breaks up with when he moves to Minsk on a research grant; Gary, a police officer whose badge she finds,
                in season five; and an on-and-off relationship with Mike Hannigan in seasons nine and ten. In season
                nine, Phoebe and Mike break up due to his desire not to marry. David returns from Minsk, leading to the
                two getting back together, but she eventually rejects him for Mike when both of them propose to her.

                Rachel, as the two drunkenly marry in Las Vegas. His divorces become a running joke within the series.
                Following a one-night stand, he and Rachel have a daughter, Emma, by the end of season eight. They
                finally confess that they are still in love with each other in the series finale.</p>
